Theoretically, you can remove this section, but it would be nice if you didn't.
This is my first JavaScript program, so it's a bit rough around the edges
(especially the fact that I shy totally away from NodeWalker and friends). Plus,
it'd be a pain to reconfigure. But hey, this syntax is new, and it took me
a long time to figure out that objects were passed by reference. That caused
problems.

As you can see above, this program is licensed under the GNU General Public
License. If you're not aware of the Free Software Foundation or similar
movements I suggest you check it out. The idea of these movements is that these
programs are free as in freedom. You can edit, you can redistribute, you
can use them freely. In fact, that would be great if you put this on your
website! Just make sure you keep the disclaimers.

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>Start the program by focusing on the text box and pressing the
        space bar. Stare at the dot on the screen. When the colored word
        appears, press the key corresponding to the <em>color</em> of the word,
        not what it says. If you get it wrong, you will be retested on it
        later in the trial.</p>
        <p>If at any time you brainfreeze or are distracted by something during
        the identification of the color, you can press the &quot;Cancel&quot;
        key (default is <code>x</code>). The word will be shuffled back into
        the trials and you'll encounter it later. (Minor caveat: if it's your
        last trial, you'll simply be retested on it again and again until you
        get it right. Just thought you might like to know.)</p>
        <p>When there is a status message on the screen, the timer is stopped,
        and you can take a break, or view the instructions again. If there is
        a dot or a colored word, the timer will not stop if you skip to another
        place, like Instructions, so you will have to invalidate that trial.</p>
        <p>You can edit the keys for the colors to something more comfortable.
        Simply press the <code>Edit</code> button, and then modify the text fields as you see
        fit, then press <code>Set</code>. Changes are not remembered.</p>

        <h2>More Information</h2>
        <p>The <b>Stroop effect</b> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"
        title="Psychology">psychology</a> is a demonstration of interference in
        the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_time"
        title="Reaction time">reaction time</a> of a task. When a word such as
        blue, green, red, etc. is printed in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"
        title="Color">color</a> differing from the color expressed by the
        word's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics"
        title="Semantics">semantic</a> meaning (ie. the word red printed in blue
        ink), a delay occurs in the processing of the word's color, leading to
        slower test reaction times and an increase in mistakes. The effect is
        named after its discover, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ridley_Stroop"
        title="John Ridley Stroop">John Ridley Stroop</a>, and was first noted
        in an article <i>Studies of interference in serial verbal reactions</i>
        published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1935" title="1935">1935</a>.</p>
